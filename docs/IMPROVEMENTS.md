# Improvements

## Block A — The client (payloads in, types out)

### §RG137 The reason that stops one layer short of the screen

RG135 made the held transport keep why it could not hold a root: the exit, and the last
line the engine wrote on stderr. That answers the test that failed with `1` is not `0`,
and nobody on a screen, because the transport is `shell`'s and what a screen reads is
`OpenProject`, which is `core`'s and has no field for it.

It matters at the moment the portfolio exists for. A project whose engine cannot hold a
session reads at seven hundred milliseconds where the rest read at six, for every read,
while the window is open. One row lagging behind sixteen is what a person notices, and
the row is where the engine's version already sits.

**The shape is the stamp's, not a new seam.** `openProject` already takes what it cannot
compute as arguments — the candidates, the transport, the stamp and, since RG122, the
closing. A fifth, `heldBy: () => string | null`, lets `openHere` answer from
`McpTransport.unheld` and a web service answer nothing, and `OpenProject` carries it as
data. Nothing in `core` learns what a process is.

**And it is a question, not a snapshot.** A handshake fails on the first read of a root,
which is after the project opened — so the field is read when the row is drawn, the way
`invalidate` is called when the disk moves, rather than stamped once at open.

Worth doing with the first row that draws engine health; before that there is nowhere to
put the sentence.

## Block B — Discovery (which checkouts on this machine are governed)

### §RG13 The cheap no

A candidate has to be rejected without reading a file. Until roadkeep answers that in
one call, this app uses the narrowest thing that exists: the presence of the config
decides the candidate, and the config read decides whether it is governed, its source
coming back null when it is not. What it must never do is walk up looking for a config
itself, which is roadkeep's own discovery rule reimplemented here and wrong the day that
rule moves. The upstream line is a dep on this one for exactly that reason.

### §RG15 The disagreement, drawn rather than resolved

The engines read answers per project with the writing copy, the plugin, the vendored
one, the gates and a verdict over the set. This block is finished when that verdict is
on the row: agreed, split, or swapped. A row that is split is not an error and must not
be drawn as one; it is a repository where two copies could write and the person needs to
know which did. What is refused is showing a count with no engine beside it, because
that count is an answer whose author has been dropped.

## Block C — The portfolio (many backlogs in one view)

## Block D — The project surface (one backlog, read)

### §RG28 The order a pause has no way to state

The store itself landed: `--stale` names the deferred role without a `--role`, the
pauses come back with their marker and the sentence the store spells, and an id now
answers open, shipped, paused or nowhere. What that half is and why it reads the
sentence whole is recorded in `packages/core/src/pauses.ts`.

What is left is the order. `--stale` computes it — how long each pause has stood, in
commits over the governed files, oldest first, with the reason beside it — and prints it
for a terminal, on stderr and never in the listing. A `--json` caller gets the store in
file order and nothing else, so this app has no age to draw and does not pretend to one.

There are two ways to reach it and only one is allowed. Reading `set aside 3 commit(s)
ago:` back out of English is the prose-scraping this client refuses on every other verb,
and a second implementation of a sentence roadkeep is free to reword. The other is for
roadkeep to put `since` and the reason in the payload as it already holds them in
`Standing` — filed as this line's dep, which nothing shipped here satisfies.

The order is not a verdict, and drawing it must not make it one. How long a pause may
stand is a judgement about work — the same one `[claims] held` refuses to make — so the
oldest is first and what that means is the reader's.

### §RG77 The reason a non-goal keeps to itself

`non-goal list --json` answers with the leads, the file, what was elided and which
designs quote each. It does not answer with the reasons, and neither does `brief`, which
prints the same leads. A criterion arrives with its `why`; a non-goal does not.

The reason is the half that decides anything. `No store of its own` is a phrase whose
argument the file spells out in a sentence, and that sentence is what a person about to
file a proposal needs. RG26 shipped the list with `answeredBy` and no `why`, faithful to
the payload rather than half-written.

There are two ways to get it and only one is allowed here. Reading `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
lifting the bullet is what `No Markdown parsed in this app` refuses, and it is the
second implementation of a grammar this app exists not to hold. The other is for
roadkeep to publish the field, the way `criterion list` already does — a key on the
payload, filed upstream in `d:/Git/alegauss/roadkeep`.

So this line waits on that, and its dep says so: nothing shipped here can ever satisfy
it, and `pick` will not offer it. What lands when the field arrives is small — the key
on `NonGoalsPayload`, the `why` on `NonGoal`, and the tests that assert a reason that is
absent today. The line exists so the gap is a filed state rather than a shape somebody
later reads as an oversight.

On ship: `--recorded-in packages/core/src/binding.ts`.

## Block E — The write path (the app composes an argv; the command writes)

## Block F — The agent surface (handing one task to Claude Code)

## Block G — The shell (an executable now, a service later)

### §RG49 The signature, and what it needs that code cannot supply

Signing is not work that can be finished by writing anything: it needs a certificate
somebody bought, held somewhere a build can reach. So the line states the requirement
and is set aside for a caller that says it has one, rather than coming back as the next
ready task forever. What can be built without it is the pipeline that would use it, and
the about surface saying plainly that this build is unsigned — which is the honest half
and is worth having on its own.

### §RG50 Updating, and what has to exist first

An update check reads a release that exists on the internet, so this line needs a
published artifact and not merely code. What it must do is state which version it is on
and which it found, and never install anything without being asked — an app that
replaces itself while somebody is reading a backlog is one that loses their place. What
it must not do is phone anywhere on launch by default: this app reads a person's
repositories, and a network call it did not need is one that has to be explained.

### §RG119 The build nobody has made

`electron-builder.yml` declares a `dmg` target with a category beside it, and that is
the whole of what this project knows about a macOS build. Nobody has run it. RG91
packaged Windows and Linux in CI and left this out deliberately: a runner is a poor
place to find out what a platform needs, because every answer arrives as a red job with
a log and no way to try the next thing without another push.

Three things are likely to want settling, and none of them is knowable from here. An
unsigned `.app` is refused by Gatekeeper on the machine that downloads it, which is a
different problem from RG49's Windows one and is not solved by the same certificate.
`spawnElectron` strips `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` and resolves a binary by a path this
project has only ever resolved on two platforms. And the live suite starts the built app
with a remote debugging port, which on macOS is the same mechanism and a different
sandbox.

So this carries `macos-machine` rather than a CI job: whoever has one runs `npm run
package`, opens what comes out, and writes down what it took. Adding `macos-latest` to
the package matrix is the last step and not the first — it is how the answer is kept,
not how it is found.

### §RG128 The engine a session actually got

The launcher resolves an engine in four steps — `ROADKEEP_HOME`, a vendored
`.roadkeep/`, the sibling `../roadkeep`, then a clone under the user cache — and takes
the first that *answers a probe*. A checkout being written while the probe runs does not
answer, so resolution falls through. During RG120 three commands were served by `0.2.4`
out of `~/.cache/roadkeep-src` while the sibling stood at `0.2.450`; `ROADKEEP_HOME` did
not help, being a candidate the same probe drops.

**Decided, and the half left is upstream's.** Three levers, measured on 2026-09-10:

- **Vendoring is rejected here.** `.roadkeep/` outranks the sibling, and this project's live suite tests the roadkeep checkout under development on purpose (`live.ts`, RG84). A pin would change what that suite tests without anything saying so, and freeze the engine on the one machine where it moves daily.
- **The launcher is not this repository's to change.** It is identical to what `roadkeep install` writes today, so an edit here is overwritten by the next refresh. Making a *named* engine fatal rather than skippable is its behaviour, and the dep names it.
- **The cache is the hazard on this machine.** It still answers — `0.2.4`, from 2026-08-28 — and is the candidate a busy sibling falls to. Removing `~/.cache/roadkeep-src` turns a stale answer into a refusal naming the missing engine: louder, and never wrong. It is a directory outside this repository, so it is named here for whoever owns the machine rather than removed.

## Block H — The look (a design system for governed prose)

### §RG62 Joining the checks the other consoles already answer to

Depending on the design system is half of consuming it. The other half is the two
mechanisms Shio and Dumont run.

**The gate is done.** `viglet-ds-check-duplicates` is wired into `npm run lint` over the
three source roots, and a test plants a duplicate and requires it to be found — because
a gate pointed at the wrong directory reports a clean tree in exactly the same words as
a clean tree, which is what both consoles learned the hard way.

**Registration is not, and is deliberately not.** The package's `consumers.json` is the
declared set it holds itself to, and its own reasoning says prose naming a subset as
though it were the whole is a test failure. The entry this app wants is:

```
{ "id": "roadkeep-gui", "name": "roadkeep", "package": "@rk/ui",
  "framework": "vite", "chrome": "console",
  "entries": [".", "./styles", "./fonts", "./preset"] }
```

`accent` is the field to stop at. Every one of the six consumers records `cool`, and the
file says so on purpose: the accent was made a token so a product could re-key without
forking a header, and none had. This app has — amber, in its own `:root`. So adding it
is not a row, it is the first case that file was written to anticipate, and the parity
digest is then required to carry that set.

That is a commit in somebody else's repository with a consequence for five other apps,
which is why it is written down here rather than made quietly.
