description: How to work a task in this project's roadmap — the five docs/ files (ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md, DECISIONS.md, DEFERRED.md) owned by the roadkeep CLI and never hand-edited, and above all the one-task-one-commit rule: every finished roadmap task ends with `run-commit.cmd -m "<title>"` from the repo root, code plus doc sync in that single commit. Use whenever adding a task, picking the next RG-number, marking a task shipped, retiring, deferring, linting, editing any of those files, executing a block or a list of RG ids, or finishing any task that touches this repo.

# Roadmap tasks & committing

## ⛔ READ FIRST — one task, one `run-commit.cmd` (non-negotiable)

**A task is not finished until the commit landed.** The commit tool is
`run-commit.cmd` (on the OS PATH, in `D:\Dev\bin`) — never `git commit` by hand:

```
cd d:\Git\alegauss\roadkeep-gui
run-commit.cmd -m "<conventional-commits title, ASCII>"
```

- **Always pass `-m`.** It stages everything and generates the body from the staged
  diff; without a title it infers one, and for a docs/ROADMAP commit that means prose
  about already-shipped work gets misread as `feat: implement <feature>`.
- **ASCII in the title.** An em dash or an accent goes through `cmd` and may not arrive
  as the bytes you typed — the same class the upstream `RK1474` recorded.
- **`cd` to the repo root first** — `run-commit.cmd` stages relative to CWD.
- **The doc sync rides in the same commit as the code**, so the governed files never
  describe a state that did not ship.
- **You may NOT do more than one task before committing.** A multi-task request
  (a whole block, or a list of `RG<n>`s) is *not* permission to batch: it is a request
  to run them one at a time, committing after each. One giant diff spanning many tasks
  is the failure this rule exists to prevent.
- **A batch of ≥2 tasks runs under the `/loop` skill** (self-paced): exactly one task
  per iteration, `run-commit.cmd` at the end of that iteration, then advance. Do not
  hand-roll a loop that defers commits to the end.
- **Self-check before starting task N+1:** `git status` / `git log -1`. If the previous
  task's work is still in the working tree, stop and commit it first.
- **Declare your paths, then read them back at the moment of committing.** A claim is dated
  by a marker write and released when the marker moves (`[claims] held = 60` minutes).
  `roadkeep claim RG<n> --path <p>` says what the task will touch; **`roadkeep claim RG<n>`
  with no `--path` answers what you declared plus what the tree holds that another live claim
  says is its own — the analysis `git add -A` cannot make.** `roadkeep claims` lists held,
  expired and stale. This matters wherever two sessions run against one checkout: in the
  sibling `pportal` repo a commit made with no live claim swallowed four files of unrelated
  work under its own title.

The same rule applies to any finished unit of work in this repo, roadmap task or not:
when the work is done and validated, commit it with `run-commit.cmd -m "…"` rather than
leaving it in the tree.

## The gate before the commit

Validated means the project's own build and test were run, not that the edit looked right.

Four commands, from the repo root, and each answers a different question:

| Command | What it holds | When |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc -b` over all three packages at once, through the project references — a renderer that broke a payload shape fails here and not in a window. It emits declarations only: `tsc` compiles nothing that runs. | Every task that touches a `.ts` or `.tsx` file. |
| `npm test` | `vitest run`, headless: `core` in Node, `ui` in jsdom. No display, so it runs the same over SSH and in CI. | Every task that changes behaviour anything asserts. |
| `roadkeep lint` | The governed files. Non-zero exit is the whole point of it. | Every task, without exception — it is the only gate a docs-only change has. |
| `npm run build` | Everything Vite produces: the main process and the two launchers into `packages/shell/dist`, the sandboxed preload as `preload.cjs` beside them, and the renderer into `packages/ui/dist`. | Before shipping anything the packaged app loads, and any task that touches a Vite config or an asset path. |

`npm run dev` opens the window against Vite with hot reload; `npm start` builds and opens
it against the bundle on disk, which is what a packaged run does. Neither is a gate — they
are how you see a change, and a screenshot beats a claim that a screen renders.

Three things worth knowing before you spend an hour on any of them.

**Every source file is TypeScript and every relative import is extensionless.** There is
no `.js`, `.mjs` or `.cjs` source in this repo — the launchers behind `npm run dev` and
`npm start` are `.ts` under `packages/shell/src` like everything else. That is what Vite
buys: it builds the main process as well as the renderer, so an import is resolved the way
a bundler resolves it and never has to name the file the compiler is about to write. The
one `.cjs` in the tree is `dist/preload.cjs`, which is build output.

**Cross-package imports go through the workspace name**, `@rk/core` and not a relative
path out of the package. The three packages are separate `tsc` projects on purpose — `core`
has neither Node nor DOM types in scope, `ui` has DOM and not Node, `shell` has Node and
not DOM — and reaching across with a `paths` alias would compile one package's source under
another's options and quietly hand it back what its own config denies it.

**`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` is exported by VS Code**, so an Electron started from an editor
terminal or an agent session runs as plain Node and dies on `app` being undefined;
`spawnElectron` strips it, which is why `npm run dev` and `npm start` go through a launcher
instead of calling the binary.

Do not invent a `compile.cmd` or `test.cmd` here because the sibling `pportal` repo has
them — the four above are this repo's.

When the suite arrives: **name EVERY task id an assertion holds, not just the one you are
working.** A test written under one id often ends up holding the task that finished the
work, and naming both is four characters, while the alternative is a second test file
written to move a number.

## ⛔ READ SECOND — five files are owned by `roadkeep`

[`roadkeep.toml`](../../../roadkeep.toml) declares this project's format — prefix `RG`,
`ref_scheme = "id"`, the markers, the limits, the requirement vocabulary — and
[`.mcp.json`](../../../.mcp.json) plus [`.claude/settings.json`](../../settings.json)
wire the rest through `.claude/hooks/roadkeep-launch.py`: a hook that **denies a
hand-edit** to any governed file and names the command that does it, the
`mcp__roadkeep__*` tools whose input schema *is* this project's format, and the upstream
`roadkeep` skill with the whole write path. **Reach for the MCP tools first**; the shell
fallback is that launcher, not a `roadkeep` on PATH.

Start a task with `brief`, not by reading the files; `lint` is the gate.

Each file has one job — never duplicate content between them:

| File | Single responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../../docs/ROADMAP.md) | **Task status** — active backlog only (📋 designed · 💭 idea · ⏳ partial · 🛠 in-progress), one line per task, plus the `## Priority` queue, the block headings, the `## Done when` criteria and the `## Non-goals`. |
| [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](../../../docs/CHANGELOG.md) | What has **shipped** — the ledger, indexed by block. Authoritative for the highest block letter. |
| [`docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../../../docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md) | **Design rationale** for *unshipped* work only. Deleted per task by the ship that closes it. |
| [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](../../../docs/DECISIONS.md) | **Constraints that outlive the work** — written only by `ship --decides`, corrected by `revise`, replaced by `supersede`. Nothing deletes an entry. |
| [`docs/DEFERRED.md`](../../../docs/DEFERRED.md) | Lines **set aside** by `defer`, keeping their id, deps, symptom and section. `resume` brings one back. |

## The loop

- **`brief --claim`** picks the next line and briefs it in one read, taking it in the same
  transaction. **Reach for `--designed`**: 49 of the 56 open lines are 💭 and their design
  is still to write, so an unscoped pick often hands you a `section add` and not a commit.
- **`--have <word>`** where the machine has one of the three declared requirements —
  `signing-cert`, `macos-machine`, `published-artifact`. Lines naming one are set aside
  and named, never silently dropped.
- **Order is the `## Priority` section of `docs/ROADMAP.md`**, not `roadkeep.toml` and not
  opinion — it currently reads `RG37`, `RG44`, `RG39`, and then the lowest ready id.
  `priority add` / `priority drop` are the doors.
- **The read BEFORE an add is `delivered <block> --near "<the sentence you would file>"`.**
  It ranks that block's nearest deliveries against what you are about to propose, which is
  the duplicate question asked *before* an id is spent.
- **Adding is `add --block <x> --symptom "…" --why "…" --section "…"`.** The `§RG<n>`
  pointer is derived. A line whose section is missing is a `ref.unresolved` finding, so
  file both halves in the one transaction. `budget` prices every field first.
- **The next id is `roadkeep next-id`** — it scans every governed file and never fills a
  gap. Retired ids are never reused.
- **Keep a task line terse** — symptom (what does not work, never a fix name) + one
  sentence of why + the pointer. The reasoning belongs in the section.

## The two lists that bind a proposal

Both are governed here and both are checked *before* work becomes a line:

- **`non-goal list`** — ten entries, and they are binding. A proposal a non-goal forbids
  is not filed. Where one merely *bounds* a line without forbidding it, the gate says so
  (`non-goal.reaches`) and the answer is recorded by quoting that lead in the line's own
  design section.
- **`criterion list`** — twenty-three entries under `## Done when — Block X`, saying what
  would finish each block. **A constraint the project must keep obeying usually belongs
  here, not in `DECISIONS.md`**: a criterion survives every ship, is never deleted, and is
  what `ship --checked <lead>` verifies.

## Shipping, and the section it deletes

`ship <id> --why "<what now works>"` writes the ledger entry, clears the roadmap line and
**deletes the design section**, in one transaction or none. That deletion is correct — a
design says how the work was built and stops being true when the code moves — but it is
the last moment anything in that section can be saved.

**Read the section before you ship it**, and ask of each paragraph: *does this stop being
true when the code moves?* Three doors, in order of how often they are the right one:

| Answer | Door |
|---|---|
| It explains **this module** | `--recorded-in <path>` — move the prose into that file's docstring or header. **This is the common case.** |
| It is a rule the project must keep obeying | usually not a ship flag at all — `criterion add` or `non-goal add`, which are never deleted |
| It is a constraint with a rejected alternative, belonging to no single file | `--decides "<the constraint>"`, plus `section add <id> --role decisions` for what was weighed (150 words) |
| You read it and it had gone stale | `--superseded-design "<what it was wrong about>"` |
| Nothing survives | ship plainly — most ships are this |

**Never copy a section into a second file.** That is the accreting rationale this format
exists to refuse.

**A design section may carry its own instruction.** Where the author already knew what
would survive, the section ends with a line naming it — `On ship: --decides "…"` or
`On ship: --recorded-in <path>`. Honour it, revised against what was actually built.

## Everything else

- **Status lives in exactly one file.** If a marker anywhere disagrees with the roadmap, the
  roadmap wins.
- **A pause is `defer <id> --reason "…"`, not `retire`.** Retiring is terminal: the id cannot
  come back, the resolver reads the dep as never, and the section is deleted.
- **A false claim is `restate <id> --symptom "…"`**, which keeps the id, the deps, the marker
  and the design — not `retire` plus `add`, which spends an id and deletes a design that was
  right.
- **Two deps point outside this backlog** — `roadkeep RK1631` and `roadkeep RK1632`, filed in
  the sibling `d:/Git/alegauss/roadkeep` checkout. They never resolve by shipping here, and
  `pick` will not offer the lines that carry them.
- **`lint` reports and `repair` spends the report** — every finding names the command that
  closes it, and `explain <code>` says what a code means before you guess.
