// The house ad slot.
//
// japode-ads is the author's own network and it is the whole of what this site loads from
// anywhere else: one script, one request per page however many slots it finds, every banner
// drawn inside its own shadow root, no impressions counted and no identifiers. The attributes
// that keep that promise sit on the container itself, in Ad.tsx, where a reviewer meets them
// next to the slot they apply to.
//
// What this module owns is the one thing the published v1 contract cannot do for a site with a
// theme toggle. The loader resolves the theme as it draws and never looks again, so a reader
// who flips the page to light afterwards keeps a dark card on it. The lever the contract does
// give a host page is `data-ad-theme`, read on every run, so the slots are written first and the
// script is run again, which redraws them from the catalogue the browser has already cached.

 * Keep this page's ad slots on the theme the page is showing.

 * Both signals are watched because the site answers to both: the toggle writes `data-theme` on
 * the root element, and a reader who never touches it is following an OS preference that
 * changes on its own. Nothing is requested until this runs, which is also the answer for a
 * reader with no JavaScript: no slot is drawn and no third party is contacted.
